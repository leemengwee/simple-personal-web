        <h1> Aspiring undergrad in biotechnology.</h1>
        <p>Greetings,</p><br>

        <img src="hike.jpeg" alt="hike.jpg">
        <p>I am an individual driven by a trio of passions that shape the essence of who I am. Science and technology
            fuel my
            intellectual curiosity, propelling me to delve into the intricate details of our world's mysteries. Coupled
            with this is
            my fervent love for solo travelâ€”a journey of self-discovery and cultural immersion that has taken me from
            the bustling
            markets of Thailand to the serene landscapes of its islands. </p>
        <p>Hailing from Malaysia, a nation known for its
            diverse
            heritage and limitless dreams, I carry the aspirations of my homeland as I embark on a path of exploration
            and
            innovation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Biotechnology definition</h2>
        <p> For me, biotechnology is a field of science which is highly relied on technology and computer science. We
            intergrate technology into scientific knowledge to create distruptive technology.</p>

        <p>What truly captivates my imagination, however, is the realm of bioenergy, specifically algae biofuel. Nestled
            at the
            intersection of science, sustainability, and innovation, this field holds the key to unlocking a greener
            future. With a
            focus on developing eco-friendly alternatives to conventional energy sources, I am determined to contribute
            my knowledge
            and enthusiasm to this cause. As I continue my journey, each experience, whether in the laboratory or on a
            distant
            shore, adds depth to my understanding and fuels my passion for shaping a more sustainable world through
            groundbreaking
            bioenergy solutions.</p></b>
